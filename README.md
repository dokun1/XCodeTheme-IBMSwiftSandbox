## About

When Alcatraz was working, I had Xcode modded out the wazoo, and I was particular about the color scheme as well. Additionally, someone from RWDevCon asked if there was a theme for the Swift Sandbox available [here](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/). So I made one, and then I got motivated to add a couple more!

These are unofficial and based on the Sandbox and the new [Carbon Design System](http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/). 

## Contribution

If you would like to make an update to an existing color scheme, consider creating a separate scheme altogether.
